# The Process

## **Organization**

### Overview
We plan on using JIRA to track our issues when it is available.
As for now, we are not using any tools to organize the team, as the work load is straight-forward and involving tools like Trello to track and plan our objectives would be more trouble than it is worth, but is being set up so it can be used later when when multiple deliverables have to be juggled.

Organization thus far includes:
- meetings in person
- keeping meeting notes in Google Docs
- assigning deliverables to team members verbally
- setting simple time frames of 2 or 3 days for current deliverables
- sprint times will be increased to 1 or 2 weeks from phase 2

### Decision Making
The decision making process is simple, it has to be unanimous among the team, but all options are considered if there is reasoning behind them.

- assigning roles is mostly voluntary
- task difficulty is assigned by talking about the problem and considering how many people would be needed to complete it within the time allotted

## **Meetings**
Meetings were all held in person for 2 hours, twice a week on Thursdays and Mondays.

## **Lessons for Next Phase**
1. Start early - we would have benefitted greatly and been able to ask more questions from the professor if we had started working on this sooner
2. More communication - there needs to more frequent updates between team members
3. Better allocation of tasks - allocating work was informal this phase (i.e. done verbally, with no documentation)
