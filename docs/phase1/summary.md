# Summary

## Project objective

Create a web application-based chatbot for the FinTech industry in the style of Facebook Messenger. The bot will provide answers given unstructured text as queries to simulate an actual conversation. It will be easy and simple to use for beginners but will also allow for advanced searching options.

## Key Users

- **Investors**: Emery Wong - A young investment banker looking to make a lot of money with his investment ventures. He graduated from university with an MBA so he is good at doing research and knows exactly what he wants when searching for information. Focused on the financial side of the FinTech industry

- **Government officers**: John A. McDonald - Government official who wants to know about the current situation of the FinTech industry so he can analyse and predict what might happen in the future. Not tech savvy so does not know how to enter concise queries to the chatbot, and will rely on full sentences. Appreciates charts and visual representations of data.

- **Co-op students**: Addie Singer - University computer science student in co-op hoping to pursue a career in FinTech. Knowledgeable in computer and uses google often, but wants results more tailored towards this particular industry. Will be wanting results about job and internship opportunities in the industry. Willing to read long articles.

## Scenarios

- Emery Wong is looking for an investment opportunity on the banking side of the FinTech industry. He has an avid interest in the latest news happening in the FinTech industry and has recently found out about the increasing popularity of mobile bank applications. He thinks there is an investment opportunity with these applications, and so has been looking into improving the user experience of mobile bank applications by researching the common problems users have with using them. He wants to make more advanced searches about the user experience of the online bank applications and also hopes to continue to be informed with the latest news of the FinTech industry.

- John A. McDonald wants to write a report on the positive effects of investment within the FinTech industry for the following Monday. He needs to analyse market investments and sales data for the report, but does not possess enough technical knowledge to search for data on the internet effectively. He is always using full, structured sentences to obtain the information he needs.

- Addie Singer dreams about working for a FinTech company that offers high salaries and an excellent working environment. She wants to do more research on the jobs and internships that have been posted on her university's job portal and also read more articles on the typical questions asked in an interview for a company in FinTech in order to succeed in her interviews. She is up to date with the latest technology because she is constantly reading articles, and so is able to successfully use advanced filters to search for her exact needs.

## Principles

**System efficiency over extremely accurate answers**

There is a lot of information, so it will be difficult to look through all results and filter accordingly, and still deliver the most relevant options to the user in a timely manner. So we agreed that the main objective of the chatbot would be to deliver answers quickly and keep the optimization of the result relevancy rather simple. This is not only for easing the complexity of the chatbot, but the increased speed will also give a better user experience, as people would be expecting quick results when they are chatting (as they would in person).

**Simple UI over extensive and robust options**

This chatbot will be about giving users an easy way to look for the information they require about a specific industry, so having a robust interface that allows them to finely tailor their search would defeat that purpose and there would be no difference between using this chatbot and just using google. There will still be a way to make your search results more specific, but will be hidden under an “Advanced search” feature, for the more experienced users to use.
