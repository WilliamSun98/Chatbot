- make developers learn instead of memorise API
- need logical consistency
- there is a bigger world than our API so the API will be larger and more complex
- keep things simple
- base urls per resource - usually 2: /collection/specific
- CRUD maps to POST GET PUT DELETE
- nouns should be plurals
- associations: link them together
- use variations with urls to make base url simple
- pagination: use limit and offset
- versioning: different versions for APIs in base url, all the way to the left
- fields as query params
